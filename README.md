# Employee-Attrition-Prediction

**Overview:**

This repository contains code for predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is developed to help organizations understand and anticipate employee turnover, allowing them to take proactive measures to improve employee retention.

**Dataset:** The dataset used for analysis is "WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv". It contains various features related to employees in a company, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.

**Model Development:** The prediction model is built using a Random Forest classifier. Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV are applied to optimize model performance.

**Recommendations:** Based on the analysis findings, recommendations are provided for reducing attrition and fostering a positive work environment conducive to employee satisfaction and retention.

**Contributing:** Contributions to the codebase are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
